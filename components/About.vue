      I have always found joy in caring for others; in the little daily things,
      making a meal for friends, or simply talking about life. Bridal hair has
      become a passion of mine because I love to care for and be a sense of calm
      for brides on one of the biggest days of their life. The quiet moments
      leading up to their wedding, hearing about their love story, and making
      them feel their most beautiful before marrying the love of their life is
      why I love what I do!
